        <p>
          Iâ€™m Yekta Akhavan. Due to my personal interest in web design and
          programming, I chose the front-end path. By following various courses
          and self-learning, I have been able to advance in this field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, to gain experience and further improve my skills, I am seeking
          opportunities to work with professional programming teams and
          companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, I am passionate about combining design and technology to
          create beautiful and functional user experiences.
